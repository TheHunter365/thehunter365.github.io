    <h1>Welcome to Vertical Dash!</h1>
    <p>
      Vertical Dash is a simple game where you control a blue ship using the space bar.
      The objective is to avoid red obstacles and score as many points as possible. The game
      speeds up as your score increases.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Press the space bar to make the ship ascend or descend.</li>
      <li>Avoid colliding with the red obstacles.</li>
      <li>Your score increases with time, and the game speeds up.</li>
      <li>The game ends if the ship collides with an obstacle.</li>
      <li>Press the space bar to restart after a game over.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How This Game Was Made</h2>
    <p>
      This game is a school project for the Faculty of Science of Rabat, and it provides an opportunity
      to showcase how the game was developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core of the game relies on the &lt;canvas&gt; element in HTML. The canvas element allows you
      to draw graphics and create interactive elements using JavaScript. Learn more about HTML5 canvas
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      The game is created using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas API. Below is a simplified version of
      the code that powers Vertical Dash. For a detailed explanation, refer to the provided JavaScript code.

      <h3>State variables</h3>
      <p>These variables track the state of the game</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          var gameOver = false; //is the game running ? will be usefull in the main gameLoop function
          var movingUp = false; //the state of the ship movement, is it up or down
          let obstacles = []; //the set of obstacles that will be drawn randomly on the canvas
          let score = 0; //current score 
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h3>Core functions</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          function drawShip() {
            //draw the ship, ship is stored in an object
          }
          function generateObstacle() {
            //Generate obstacles randomly and add them to the array above using Math.random()
          }
          function drawObstacles() {
            //draw the obstacles, i used the forEach method to iterate on the list

            //check for collisions
            //update the score
            //update the speed
            //update the ship position
            //generate obstacles
            //check if the game is over
            //if not, call the gameLoop function again
