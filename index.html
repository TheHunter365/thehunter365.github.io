    <h1>Welcome to Vertical Dash!</h1>
    <p>
      Vertical Dash is a simple game where you control a blue ship using the space bar.
      The objective is to avoid red obstacles and score as many points as possible. The game
      speeds up as your score increases.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Press the space bar or click to make the ship ascend or descend.</li>
      <li>Avoid colliding with the red obstacles.</li>
      <li>Your score increases with time, and the game speeds up.</li>
      <li>The game ends if the ship collides with an obstacle.</li>
      <li>Press the space bar to restart after a game over.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why this game was made</h2>
    <p>
